## Created by: CASTILLO, Aurabella Macy F.
#### I am a 2nd Year Electronics Engineering Student from University of Santo Tomas.
#### This is my 3rd Experiment-Programming Assignment for ECE2112 (Advance Programming).
#### The following are the Intended Learning Outcomes for this assignment:
#### 1. To identify the codes and functions incorporated in the Pandas library
#### 2. To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program using a Pandas library
## **Description**: This Repository contains TWO Jupyter Notebooks that mainly revolves around Python Data Analysis
## 1st Jupyter Notebook: Castillo_Pandas-P1.py
### **Problem 1**: Using knowledge obtained from the experiment and demonstrations:
#### a. Load the corresponding .csv file into a data frame named cars using pandas
#### b. Display the first five and last five rows of the resulting cars.
#### *Expected OutcomeS:*
#### *a. Loaded CSV file converted into a pandas data frame.*
#### *b.1. Indexed Data from the FIRST FIVE rows of the Data Frame*
#### *b.2. Indexed Data from the LAST FIVE rows of the Data Frame*
