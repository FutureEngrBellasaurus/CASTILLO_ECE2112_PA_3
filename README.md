# CASTILLO_ECE2112_PA_3
## Created by: CASTILLO, Aurabella Macy F.
#### I am a 2nd Year Electronics Engineering Student from the University of Santo Tomas.
#### This is my 3rd Experiment-Programming Assignment for ECE2112 (Advance Programming).
#### The following are the Intended Learning Outcomes for this assignment:
#### 1. To identify the codes and functions incorporated in the Pandas library
#### 2. To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program using a Pandas library
## **Description**: This Repository contains TWO Jupyter Notebooks that mainly revolves around Python Data Analysis
## 1st Python File: Castillo_Pandas-P1.py
### **Problem 1**: Using knowledge obtained from the experiment and demonstrations:
#### a. Load the corresponding .csv file into a data frame named cars using pandas
#### b. Display the first five and last five rows of the resulting cars.
#### *Expected Outcomes:*
#### *a. Loaded CSV file converted into a pandas data frame.*
#### *b.1. Indexed Data from the FIRST FIVE rows of the Data Frame*
#### *b.2. Indexed Data from the LAST FIVE rows of the Data Frame*
## 2nd Python File: Castillo_Pandas-P2.py
### **Problem 1**: Using the dataframe cars in problem 1, extract the following information using subsetting, slicing and indexing operations.
#### a. Display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7…) of cars.
#### b. Display the row that contains the ‘Model’ of ‘Mazda RX4’.
#### c. How many cylinders (‘cyl’) does the car model ‘Camaro Z28’ have?
#### d. Determine how many cylinders (‘cyl’) and what gear type (‘gear’) do the car models ‘Mazda RX4 Wag’, ‘Ford Pantera L’ and ‘Honda Civic’ have.
#### *Expected Outcomes:*
#### *a. First five rows wih odd-numbered columns.*
#### *b. 'Mazda RX4' Cars.*
#### *c Numbers of 'cyl' that Camaro Z28 has.*
#### *d. Number of cylinders and the gear types of Mazda RX4 Wag, Ford Pantera L, and Honda Civic*
